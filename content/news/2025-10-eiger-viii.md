This work presents the discovery of large galaxy overdensities at z~6, around which signature of Population III stars are detected. This is the first case, where several OI absorption systems are discovered around galaxy overdensities int he EIGER survey, which are all showing chemical signature of Population III stars. (Higginson et al. 2025).
