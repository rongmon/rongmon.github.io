# Research Overview
## The Cosmic Baryon Cycle

Galaxies are shaped by the perpetual flow of gas—flowing into and out of galaxies. More than 80% of the universe's baryons exist in vast, invisible halos of gas around galaxies, fueling their growth and sculpting their destinies. Understanding this cosmic interchange is the frontier of modern galaxy evolution studies. My research group investigates three interconnected questions that drive galaxy evolution:

### [1. How do galaxies like the Milky Way become what they are?](/research/milky-way-evolution/)
We study nearby and low-redshift galaxies to understand their assembly history. Our work on the **[Fermi Bubbles](/research/fermi-bubbles/)**—giant outflows from our galactic center—reveals the dynamical processes that shape galactic halos. Combined with study of **[circumgalactic medium](/research/cgm/)** around low-z galaxies, we trace how past feedback events left their imprint on galactic structure and kinematics today.

### [2. How do galaxies quench star formation?](/research/galaxy-quenching/)
Massive outflows driven by star formation and active galactic nuclei regulate whether galaxies continue forming stars or fade into dormancy. Using gravitational lensing and high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure **galactic outflows** at multiple redshifts, revealing how these powerful winds transport metals and gas far from galaxies—determining their evolutionary fate.

### [3. How do galaxies acquire their mass?](/research/mass-acquisition/)
With the James Webb Space Telescope, we peer into the epoch of reionization to witness how the first galaxies ignited the universe. Our **EIGER survey** reveals how young galaxies efficiently acquire gas from the cosmic web and how they enrich the intergalactic medium—demonstrating that galaxy growth is fundamentally connected to large-scale structure.

### Our Approach
To unlock these secrets, we employ cutting-edge multi-wavelength observations across ultraviolet, optical, and radio wavelengths. We leverage **gravitational lensing**—nature's cosmic magnifying glass—and wide-field Integral Field Spectroscopy to achieve unprecedented resolution of gas dynamics. Through absorption line spectroscopy in distant quasars and galaxies, we trace invisible reservoirs, revealing how gas flows regulate star formation, drive evolution, and sculpt the structure of the universe.
