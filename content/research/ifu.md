# New observations with Integral Field Spectrographs

![IFU](/images/IFU.jpg)

An Integral field spectrograph is a spectrograph equipped with an integral field unit (IFU). In this method, the light from each pixel of the detector is fed into a spectrograph, which generates a spectrum for each individual pixel. This muliplexing capability allows one to obtain spectra of every single pixel of an image simultaneously. This is a game changer in terms of how astropysical observations are carried out.

Please look [here](https://www.eso.org/public/usa/teles-instr/technology/ifu/) for a nice description of how IFUs work.

In recent years, several integral field spectrographs which cover large fields of view have come online (e.g. VLT/MUSE, Keck/KCWI) and several (Llama/Magellan) are coming online in the near future. I am heavily involved with IFU observations and software development to get the best out of these amazing instruments. I am leading several efforts to use these IFUs and study the gas flow around galaxies in 3D.
