## Overview

Galaxies do not exist in isolation—they are embedded in vast networks of gas and dark matter that extend far beyond their stars. To understand how galaxies grow from the cosmic dawn to the present day, we must study how they acquire mass from their surroundings and how they transform the intergalactic medium through feedback. Our research spans the full cosmic history, from nearby galaxies to the epoch of reionization, revealing **how gas flows in and out of galaxies regulate their growth and transform the Universe itself**.

## Why It Matters

Galaxy mass assembly is one of the central problems in astrophysics. The connection between the small-scale physics of star formation and the large-scale structure of the Universe is mediated by the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. How efficiently do galaxies acquire gas? How much of their acquired gas is converted into stars versus ejected as outflows? How do galaxies enrich their surroundings with the products of nuclear synthesis?

These questions are critical for understanding the fundamental process of galaxy evolution. They also connect to major observational puzzles: the nature of the universe's "missing baryons" (most of which reside in extended gaseous halos), the origin of the intergalactic medium's metal enrichment, and the mechanisms that regulate star formation in galaxies across cosmic time.

## Our Multi-Epoch Approach

We employ complementary observational techniques tailored to each cosmic epoch:

- **z < 1 (The Late Universe)**: Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy and large ground-based surveys to map extended circumgalactic gas reservoirs around hundreds to thousands of galaxies, revealing how feedback and accretion operate today.

- **z ~ 1-3 (Cosmic Noon)**: Gravitational lensing combined with high-resolution integral field spectroscopy to resolve circumgalactic structure on 100-parsec scales, revealing small-scale gas dynamics and accretion flows.

- **z > 4 (Cosmic Dawn)**: James Webb Space Telescope observations to directly witness how the first galaxies acquire gas and produce ionizing radiation, transforming the intergalactic medium and driving cosmic reionization.

## z < 1: The Late Universe Circumgalactic Medium

The circumgalactic medium around nearby and low-redshift galaxies preserves the fossil record of galactic evolution. By studying how gas is distributed, what chemical elements are present, and how gas flows in and out of galaxies today, we understand the processes that drive galaxy growth.

### Extended Gas Reservoirs and Metal Content

Our Hubble Space Telescope surveys reveal that cool circumgalactic gas extends to distances of 100-200 kpc around galaxies, containing massive metal reservoirs. Using the COS-Dwarfs survey, we discovered that the carbon mass in the circumgalactic medium of low-mass galaxies often exceeds the carbon locked in stellar populations—a striking demonstration that extended gas halos are fundamental reservoirs for galaxy evolution.

Key discoveries include:

- **Extended metal halos**: Multiple ionization states (C IV, Mg II, O VI) trace gas spanning from the inner 10 kpc to the outer 100+ kpc regions of galaxies.

- **Azimuthal asymmetry**: The circumgalactic gas distribution around disk galaxies is strongly asymmetric, revealing bipolar outflow geometries aligned with disk rotation axes—direct evidence of feedback-driven winds.

- **Dependence on galaxy properties**: Circumgalactic gas strength correlates with stellar mass, star formation rate, and galaxy color, demonstrating that galaxies actively regulate their gas halos.

- **Cooling flows**: Highly ionized gas (O VI, N V) traces radiatively cooling flows around galaxies, providing observational evidence for theoretical predictions of gas cooling onto galaxies.

### Mapping the 2D Circumgalactic Medium

Ground-based spectroscopy of thousands of galaxies reveals the two-dimensional distribution of gas. Using background galaxies and quasars as backlights, we map Mg II absorption around 4000+ low-redshift galaxies, discovering strong azimuthal asymmetries and radial falloff patterns. These observations reveal that circumgalactic gas is not uniformly distributed but organized by feedback and accretion processes.

## z ~ 1-3: Cosmic Noon and Spatially-Resolved Gas Dynamics

At cosmic noon, galaxies undergo their most intense transformation, with star formation at peak rates and rapid assembly of stellar mass. By combining gravitational lensing with integral field spectroscopy, we resolve circumgalactic gas structure on scales of 100 parsecs—a thousand times smaller than direct observations of unlensed galaxies.

### Small-Scale Structure in the Circumgalactic Medium

Gravitational lensing magnifies distant galaxies, providing a natural "cosmic telescope" that reveals structures typically invisible to direct observation:

- **Cloud-scale clumping**: Individual clouds of circumgalactic gas are resolved, revealing that gas is not smoothly distributed but clumpy and structured.

- **Kinematic complexity**: Gas flows at multiple velocities, indicating simultaneous infall, outflow, and circulation around galaxies.

- **Connection to star formation**: The small-scale structure of outflows directly traces the underlying star formation distribution, demonstrating that feedback operates locally rather than globally.

- **Accretion signatures**: High-resolution spectroscopy reveals smooth velocity patterns consistent with gas accreting from the cosmic web onto galaxies.

### Spatially-Resolved Cold Gas Fueling Star Formation

High-resolution studies of damped Lyman alpha systems reveal massive reservoirs of cold, neutral hydrogen concentrated in spatially-resolved structures around galaxies at z ~ 2-3. These observations demonstrate that galaxies at cosmic noon have accumulated enormous masses of cold gas—the fuel for the next generation of stars—ready to power continued star formation and galactic growth.

## z > 4-7: Cosmic Dawn and the EIGER Survey

The **[EIGER survey](https://eiger-jwst.github.io/index.html)** represents a paradigm shift in how we study early galaxy evolution. Using JWST's unprecedented infrared sensitivity, we directly observe galaxies in the epoch of reionization (z > 6), revealing their star formation rates, metallicities, and physical properties with exquisite detail. Remarkably, our EIGER observations have even uncovered evidence for Population III stars persisting to z ~ 6, connected to the most massive galaxy overdensities—a finding that revolutionizes our understanding of the earliest stellar populations.

### The First Galaxies and Cosmic Reionization

Our EIGER results demonstrate that **young galaxies efficiently acquire gas from the cosmic web and convert it into stars at remarkably high efficiencies**. The survey reveals:

- **High ionizing photon production**: Early galaxies produce sufficient ionizing radiation to drive cosmic reionization, transforming neutral hydrogen into ionized gas throughout the Universe.

- **Rapid metal enrichment**: Despite their youth, these galaxies have already achieved substantial metal enrichment through massive stars and supernovae, demonstrating that nucleosynthesis proceeds rapidly in the early Universe.

- **Connection to large-scale structure**: The spatial distribution of early galaxies closely follows large-scale structure, revealing that galaxies preferentially form in overdense regions.

- **Star formation efficiency**: The conversion of acquired gas into stars proceeds at remarkable efficiency, approaching the cosmic baryon fraction limit.

### The Intergalactic Medium at Cosmic Dawn

Through absorption spectroscopy, we trace how the intergalactic medium transforms as galaxies reionize it. Metal-enriched gas reveals how early galactic feedback enriches the intergalactic medium, leaving imprints that persist billions of years.
