# Astrophysical Codes

We have developed a suite of extensive python-based software packages for astrophysical research. This page will be periodically updated. Note, all these codes are open source and available on GitHub. These are actively under development, so please check the respective GitHub repositories for the latest updates, documentation, and installation instructions. If you use any of these codes in your research, please consider citing the relevant zenodo release or the associated research papers.
